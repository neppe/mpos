Dependencies
============

The Verifone mPOS uses Crashlytics from fabric.io for crash reporting.

To compile mPOS you need to obtain your own free fabric API key by signing up for a free 
fabric account at https://fabric.io/sign_up

Once you have the API key, update the FABRIC_API_KEY variable in the release.properties file
with your API key.
